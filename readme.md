This is the Library assignment from The Odin Project. 

Challenges:
- The hardest part was accessing library items using DOM, and I spent some time getting this right. 
Once I got that working, the rest of the project was smooth sailing. 
- @media rules was easier than anticipated. With a bit of tinkering on the CSS, spacing and layout for different
viewports worked just fine!

Areas to practice:
- Still need to practice arrow functions, and I need to revisit some of the lections on array manipulation. 
- I'm starting to think I should find or make some rules for clean, consistent code.
